# ðŸ“ˆ Google Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

Welcome to this project where we dive into the world of deep learning to predict **Google stock prices** using historical data! This notebook leverages an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural network â€” one of the most powerful tools for sequence and time series prediction.

ðŸ§  About the Project

This project explores:
- Real-world financial data from Google (GOOG)
- Data preprocessing and scaling techniques
- Preparing time-series sequences for training
- Building and training an LSTM model
- Predicting and visualizing the future trends of stock prices.
